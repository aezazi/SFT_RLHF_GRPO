        "## Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an LLM\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that creating a ChatGPT at home involves 3 steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. pre-training a large language model (LLM) to predict the next token on internet-scale data, on clusters of thousands of GPUs. One calls the result a \"base model\"\n",
        "2. supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to turn the base model into a useful assistant\n",
        "3. human preference fine-tuning which increases the assistant's friendliness, helpfulness and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 2. This involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT for short), also called instruction tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised fine-tuning takes in a \"base model\" from step 1, i.e. a model that has been pre-trained on predicting the next token on internet text, and turns it into a \"chatbot\"/\"assistant\". This is done by fine-tuning the model on human instruction data, using the cross-entropy loss. This means that the model is still trained to predict the next token, although we now want the model to generate useful completions given an instruction like \"what are 10 things to do in London?\", \"How can I make pancakes?\" or \"Write me a poem about elephants\".\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, one requires human annotators to collect useful completions, on which we can train the model. OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to generate useful completions given instructions, like \"In London, you can visit the Big Ben and (...)\". A nice collection of openly available SFT datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-sft-datasets-65788b571bf8e371c4e4241a).\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, the model becomes more useful: rather than simply predicting the next token (which might give undesirable outputs, like generating follow-up questions rather than answering the question), we now make it more likely that the model will output useful completions for any instruction we give it. We basically steer it in the direction of generating useful completions which a human could have written given any instruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* the entire notebook is based on and can be seen as an annotated version of the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) developed by Hugging Face, and more specifically the [recipe](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/blob/main/recipes/zephyr-7b-beta/sft/config_lora.yaml) used to train Zephyr-7b-beta. Huge kudos to the team for creating this!\n",
        "* this notebook applies to any decoder-only LLM available in the Transformers library. In this notebook, we are going to fine-tune the [Mistral-7B base model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1), which is one of the best open-source large language models at the time of writing."

For policymakers, strategies such as implementing progressive tax policies and providing social safety nets can help to reduce income inequality, which can improve mental health outcomes. For healthcare providers, focusing on early intervention and providing access to mental health treatment can help reduce the incidence of adverse mental health outcomes associated with income inequality.

The United States: The U.S. Has one of the highest levels of income inequality among developed countries, and this has been associated with higher rates of depression and anxiety, as well as lower life expectancies and other poor health outcomes. 2. Latin America: Studies have shown that income inequality is strongly associated with higher rates of depression and anxiety in Latin America, which has some of the highest levels of income inequality in the world. 3. Southeast Asia: Income inequality is also a significant problem in many countries in Southeast Asia, and has been linked to poor mental health outcomes such as depression and substance abuse. In terms of the effectiveness of progressive tax policies in reducing income inequality and improving mental health outcomes, studies suggest that these policies can have a positive impact. For example, a study in the UK found that a more progressive tax policy led to significant reductions in mental health inequalities.

For instance, a study published in the International Journal of Mental Health Systems analyzed the relationship between income inequality and mental health in 36 countries. The study found that countries with more progressive tax policies had lower levels of income inequality and better mental health outcomes.

            "Sure, income inequality has been linked to mental health problems in many Southeast Asian countries. For example, a study on income inequality and mental health in Vietnam found that there is a significant association between income inequality and depressive symptoms among older adults. The study suggested that older adults living in areas with higher levels of income inequality are more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Another study conducted in Indonesia found that income inequality was associated with increased rates of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. The study found that individuals living in regions with higher levels of income inequality tend to feel more stressed and face more social pressures, which can negatively impact mental health outcomes. Regarding the impact of tax policies, progressive tax policies aim to tax higher-income earners at a higher rate than lower-income earners. On the other hand, flat tax policies aim to apply a uniform tax rate to all income earners, regardless of their income level. While both tax policies generate revenue for the government, progressive tax policies are generally seen as more effective in reducing income inequality and improving mental health outcomes. A study conducted by the OECD found that progressive tax systems are more effective than flat tax systems in reducing income inequality. The study also highlighted that countries with more progressive tax systems tend to have higher levels of social spending, which is associated with better mental health outcomes. While more research is needed on this topic, these findings suggest that progressive tax policies can play an important role in reducing income inequality and improving mental health outcomes.</s>\n",

        "### Full fine-tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically, one performs \"full fine-tuning\": this means that we will simply update all the weights of the base model during fine-tuning. This is then typically done either in full precision (float32), or mixed precision (a combination of float32 and float16). However, with ever larger models like LLMs, this becomes infeasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "For reference, float32 means that each parameter of a model gets saved in 32 bits or 4 bytes. Hence, for a 7 billion parameter model like Mistral-7B, one requires 7 billion parameters \\* 4 bytes per parameter = 28 GB of GPU RAM, just to load the model. During training with an optimizer like AdamW, one not only requires memory for the model but also for the gradients and optimizer states, which roughly comes down to approximately 18 times the size of the model in gigabytes when training with mixed precision, in this case 7 * 18 = 126 GB of GPU RAM. And that's just for a 7B parameter model! See the guide for more info: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.1/en/perf_train_gpu_one.\n",

The idea here is that, rather than performing full fine-tuning, we are going to freeze the existing model and only add a few parameter weights to the model (called \"adapters\"), which we're going to train.\n",
        "\n",
        "LoRa is what we call a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. It's a popular method for fine-tuning models in a parameter-efficient way, by only training a few adapters, keeping the existing model untouched. LoRa is available in the [PEFT library](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/index) by Hugging Face, which also supports various other PEFT methods (but LoRa is the most popular one at the time of writing).\n",

        "\n",
        "With regular LoRa, one would keep the base model in 32 or 16 bits in memory, and then train the parameter weights. However, there have been new methods developed to shrink the size of a model considerably, to 8 or 4 bits per parameter (we call this [\"quantization\"](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization)). Hence, if we apply LoRa to a quantized model (like a 4-bit model), then we call this QLoRa. We have a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) that tells you all about it. There are various quantization methods available, here we're going to use the [BitsandBytes](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization#transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig) integration.\n"

One typically applies LoRa on the linear projection matrices of the attention layers of a Transformer. We then provide this configuration to the SFTTrainer class.
