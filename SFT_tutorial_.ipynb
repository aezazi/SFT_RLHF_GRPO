        "## Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an LLM\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that creating a ChatGPT at home involves 3 steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. pre-training a large language model (LLM) to predict the next token on internet-scale data, on clusters of thousands of GPUs. One calls the result a \"base model\"\n",
        "2. supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to turn the base model into a useful assistant\n",
        "3. human preference fine-tuning which increases the assistant's friendliness, helpfulness and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 2. This involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT for short), also called instruction tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised fine-tuning takes in a \"base model\" from step 1, i.e. a model that has been pre-trained on predicting the next token on internet text, and turns it into a \"chatbot\"/\"assistant\". This is done by fine-tuning the model on human instruction data, using the cross-entropy loss. This means that the model is still trained to predict the next token, although we now want the model to generate useful completions given an instruction like \"what are 10 things to do in London?\", \"How can I make pancakes?\" or \"Write me a poem about elephants\".\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, one requires human annotators to collect useful completions, on which we can train the model. OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to generate useful completions given instructions, like \"In London, you can visit the Big Ben and (...)\". A nice collection of openly available SFT datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-sft-datasets-65788b571bf8e371c4e4241a).\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, the model becomes more useful: rather than simply predicting the next token (which might give undesirable outputs, like generating follow-up questions rather than answering the question), we now make it more likely that the model will output useful completions for any instruction we give it. We basically steer it in the direction of generating useful completions which a human could have written given any instruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* the entire notebook is based on and can be seen as an annotated version of the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) developed by Hugging Face, and more specifically the [recipe](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/blob/main/recipes/zephyr-7b-beta/sft/config_lora.yaml) used to train Zephyr-7b-beta. Huge kudos to the team for creating this!\n",
        "* this notebook applies to any decoder-only LLM available in the Transformers library. In this notebook, we are going to fine-tune the [Mistral-7B base model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1), which is one of the best open-source large language models at the time of writing."

Whether it is a simple smile from a stranger or a heartfelt gesture from a loved one, these small acts of kindness can lift our spirits and brighten our day. However, what many of us fail to realize is that kindness is not just something we receive, but also something we can actively practice and give to others.\n",

            "Random acts of kindness are small, simple acts that are often unexpected and can have a profound impact on the person receiving it. These acts do not have to be elaborate or expensive, but the effects can be quite powerful. Here are a few benefits of practicing random acts of kindness:\n",

            "Kindness has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health. According to a study published in the Journal of Social Psychology, those who engage in regular acts of kindness experience lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. When we are kind to others, it boosts our own mood and sense of well-being.\n",

            "\n",
            "Real-life examples of the impact of small acts of kindness are not hard to find. One such example is John O'Leary, a burn survivor who was given just a 1% chance of survival when he was nine years old. During his recovery, he received countless small acts of kindness from nurses, therapists, and family members. It was through these small but meaningful gestures that he was able to find hope and healing, and ultimately build a life of purpose and positivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another example is a recent viral video of a man who saw a single mom struggling to pay for her groceries. He stepped in to pay for her entire cart, and the video of the kind gesture quickly spread across social media. The video touched the hearts of millions of people around the world, inspiring them to spread kindness and generosity wherever they could.\n",

            "3. Show Empathy\n",
            "\n",
            "If someone in your life is going through a tough time, take the time to listen to them and express empathy for what they are going through. This can be a powerful way to show kindness and support.\n",

What did you do well? What could you improve on? What lessons did you learn? 4. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness is a form of self-reflection that involves being present in the moment and non-judgmentally observing your thoughts and feelings. Practicing mindfulness can help you become more self-aware. 5. Seek feedback: Ask for feedback from others on your behavior and actions. This can help you see things from a different perspective and gain insights into how you can grow and improve. 6. Practice gratitude: Reflect on what you're grateful for each day. This can help you focus on the positive aspects of your life and cultivate a more positive outlook. 7. Set goals: Set specific and measurable goals for personal growth and reflect on your progress towards those goals regularly. Remember, self-reflection is a journey.

        "### Full fine-tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically, one performs \"full fine-tuning\": this means that we will simply update all the weights of the base model during fine-tuning. This is then typically done either in full precision (float32), or mixed precision (a combination of float32 and float16). However, with ever larger models like LLMs, this becomes infeasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "For reference, float32 means that each parameter of a model gets saved in 32 bits or 4 bytes. Hence, for a 7 billion parameter model like Mistral-7B, one requires 7 billion parameters \\* 4 bytes per parameter = 28 GB of GPU RAM, just to load the model. During training with an optimizer like AdamW, one not only requires memory for the model but also for the gradients and optimizer states, which roughly comes down to approximately 18 times the size of the model in gigabytes when training with mixed precision, in this case 7 * 18 = 126 GB of GPU RAM. And that's just for a 7B parameter model! See the guide for more info: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.1/en/perf_train_gpu_one.\n",

The idea here is that, rather than performing full fine-tuning, we are going to freeze the existing model and only add a few parameter weights to the model (called \"adapters\"), which we're going to train.\n",
        "\n",
        "LoRa is what we call a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. It's a popular method for fine-tuning models in a parameter-efficient way, by only training a few adapters, keeping the existing model untouched. LoRa is available in the [PEFT library](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/index) by Hugging Face, which also supports various other PEFT methods (but LoRa is the most popular one at the time of writing).\n",

        "\n",
        "With regular LoRa, one would keep the base model in 32 or 16 bits in memory, and then train the parameter weights. However, there have been new methods developed to shrink the size of a model considerably, to 8 or 4 bits per parameter (we call this [\"quantization\"](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization)). Hence, if we apply LoRa to a quantized model (like a 4-bit model), then we call this QLoRa. We have a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) that tells you all about it. There are various quantization methods available, here we're going to use the [BitsandBytes](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization#transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig) integration.\n"

One typically applies LoRa on the linear projection matrices of the attention layers of a Transformer. We then provide this configuration to the SFTTrainer class.
